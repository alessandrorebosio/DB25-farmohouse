            Welcome to Campo Verde: a farmhouse that combines family hospitality, farm-to-table dining,
            swimming pool, animal activities, and sports facilities. The website allows you to explore services, check
            availability, and easily book online.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can book rooms, tables, pool loungers (2-hour slots), sports fields, and register for events;
            registered users can manage their bookings, purchase custom packages, and leave reviews.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each booking is confirmed by email; staff have access to a dashboard to monitor
            occupancy, bookings, and reviews, and to manage offers and shifts.
